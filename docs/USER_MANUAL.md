## Tips & Best Practices

### Navigation Tips

1. **Search by building code** - "ENG" is faster than "Engineering Building"

2. **Use voice navigation** - Keep your phone in your pocket and listen

3. **Check accessible routes** - Even if you don't need them, they're often smoother paths

4. **Watch videos for complex buildings** - Interior navigation is easier with video guides

5. **Favorite frequent destinations** - Quick access to your regular spots

### Parking Tips

1. **Check predictions before leaving home** - Plan arrival time based on availability

2. **Report when you park** - Help your fellow students

3. **Always save your vehicle location** - Especially in large lots

4. **Take a photo** - A quick picture is worth a thousand notes

5. **Set alerts for morning classes** - Know when lots fill up

### Study Assistant Tips

1. **Upload early in the semester** - Build your document library over time

2. **Use study plans for exam prep** - Let AI structure your review

3. **Take quizzes regularly** - Spaced repetition improves retention

4. **Ask specific questions** - "Explain equation 3.2" works better than "help me understand"

5. **Break down assignments immediately** - Don't wait until the last minute

### Accessibility Tips

1. **Try voice guidance even if you don't need it** - It's hands-free navigation

2. **Adjust font size for outdoor use** - Larger text is easier in sunlight

3. **Enable high contrast at night** - Reduces eye strain

4. **Use haptic feedback** - Feel confirmation without looking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Location not found"

**Problem:** The app can't determine your location

**Solutions:**
1. Check that Location Services are enabled for NavEd in your device settings
2. Make sure you're not in airplane mode
3. Go outside - GPS works better with a clear sky view
4. Restart the app
5. Restart your device

#### "Map not loading"

**Problem:** The map appears blank or doesn't load

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try switching between WiFi and mobile data
3. Clear app cache (Settings → Data & Storage → Clear Cache)
4. Restart the app
5. Check if OpenStreetMap servers are running (rare issue)

#### "Navigation route not showing"

**Problem:** You can't see the route on the map

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure start and end points are on campus
2. Try zooming out to see the full route
3. Check if "Accessible Routes Only" is enabled (might limit options)
4. Try a different destination first to test

#### "Documents won't upload"

**Problem:** File upload fails or times out

**Solutions:**
1. Check file size is under 10 MB
2. Verify file type is supported (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT)
3. Ensure you have internet connection
4. Try a smaller file first to test
5. Convert PDF to TXT if PDF processing fails

#### "AI not responding"

**Problem:** The study assistant doesn't reply

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify your API key is entered correctly
3. Check if you've hit rate limits (wait a few minutes)
4. Try a different AI provider in Settings
5. Try a simpler question first

#### "Parking data seems wrong"

**Problem:** Availability doesn't match reality

**Solutions:**
1. Remember: data is crowdsourced and may be delayed
2. Check "Last Updated" timestamp
3. Submit your own report to help correct it
4. Predictions are estimates, not guarantees

#### "Voice guidance not working"

**Problem:** No audio from voice navigation
